/*
 * nextor.h - Nextor kernel mapper for the RISKYMSX2 cartridge.
 *
 * The mapper is ASCII16K + a mailbox window punched out of the bank:
 *
 *   0x4000..0x7FFF : 16 KiB bank n of the embedded kernel ROM
 *                    (nextor_rom[], flash-resident)
 *   0x6000 (W)     : select bank n for page 1
 *   0x8000..0xBFFF : 16 KiB bank m of the same ROM
 *   0x7000 (W)     : select bank m for page 2
 *   0x77FF (W)     : alias of 0x7000 (some Nextor drivers use it)
 *   0x7FF0..0x7FF5 : mailbox, decoded by address in every paged-in bank
 *
 * nextor_rom[] is the 128 KiB image built by
 * `make -C MSXSoftware/NextorDriver` (Nextor-3.0.RISKYMSX2.ROM) and
 * embedded by the firmware Makefile's regenerate_nextor_rom target.
 * 128 KiB = 8 banks x 16 KiB, so the bank number in a 0x6000 / 0x7000
 * write is 0..7.
 *
 * The kernel's own driver (MSXSoftware/NextorDriver/driver.asm) runs
 * from page 1 and reaches the disk ONLY through the mailbox. It has no
 * other hardware interface: no I/O ports, no ATA task file, no Z80 RAM
 * work area. That is why the mailbox is the single extension point.
 *
 * Bus-cycle routing and the ASCII16K bank decode live in
 * cart.c::Cart_EXTI0_Nextor_Handler; everything behind the mailbox
 * (command dispatch, result FIFO, disk access) lives in nextor.c.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The device
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The driver reports ONE device to the kernel (driver query 5 answers 1, and
 * the jump table in driver.asm is the only place that number is written
 * down). That one device IS the USB stick: the raw SCSI medium, addressed by
 * LBA, with its capacity and block size taken from READ CAPACITY during
 * enumeration. There is no filesystem anywhere in the data path - no FatFs,
 * no f_lseek, no file handle - and no container image standing in for the
 * medium. Backed by raw_disk.c.
 *
 * That means the drive looks to Nextor exactly as an IDE disk looks, and the
 * kernel's own machinery does the rest: sector 0 is an MBR, the MBR's
 * partition entries lead to a FAT volume, and the volume's boot sector is
 * what gets executed. driver.asm is written in the shape of the reference
 * Sunrise IDE driver for Nextor v3 for the same reason - it is the case this
 * hardware actually is.
 *
 * Having exactly one device is also why the wire protocol carries NO device
 * byte. Version 2 prepended one to every device-scoped command so that two
 * devices could share one command set; with one device it is a field that
 * can only ever be wrong, and the boot log showed it going wrong.
 * Reintroducing it (and the dispatch table behind it) is a clean future step
 * once a second medium exists, not something to carry now.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Version 3 of the wire protocol
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * v1 had a single device and no device byte. v2 added the device byte
 * anyway, for a second device that has since been replaced by the raw stick
 * itself. v3 drops the byte again and changes two answers:
 *
 *   - CAPACITY now returns the whole 12-byte Nextor parameter block
 *     (medium type, sector size, sector count, flags, CHS) instead of
 *     blocks + blocksize. The kernel wants all twelve bytes anyway, so this
 *     removes the driver assembling byte by byte a block it could only
 *     partly invent, and turns "no medium" into an ordinary answer
 *     (sector count 0) instead of a special path through the driver.
 *
 *   - IDENT is new: it returns the stick's INQUIRY strings, so Nextor's
 *     device screen names the actual drive instead of a hardcoded label.
 *
 * The handshake answer carries the version byte and driver.asm checks it
 * against MB_EXPECT, so a driver built against one revision and a firmware
 * built against the other fails the handshake at boot - loudly, with the
 * kernel skipping this driver - rather than answering every command with
 * arguments in the wrong places.
 *
 * The mailbox window itself has NOT moved. It is decoded by address in
 * every paged-in bank and the window test in cart.c keeps A0..A3, so the
 * register layout is tied to the low address bits and changing it would mean
 * changing the decode. It has been 0x7FF0..0x7FF5 since v1 and stays there.
